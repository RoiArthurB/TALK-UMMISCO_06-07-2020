# Exploring agent based models

From laptop to world class HPC

# Who am I ?

Let me introduce myself

---

## Arthur Brugiere

- Finished my Master at the USTH (Vietnam)

- Engineer on projects ANR ESCAPE & COMOKIT
- Working on GAMA for 2 years

- Mostly involved in _Big Data_, model exploration and _High Performance Computing_ (HPC) usage

- Should start a thesis next year

# What's ESCAPE

**Exploring by Simulation Cities Awareness on Population Evacuation**

---

<!-- _footer: "" -->

## ESCAPE: city scale evacuation

- **Hazard**: It never sticks to the plan

- **Environment**: _Roads_ and _buildings_ turn into enemies

- **Human behavior**: _People_ do everything to make the plan fail

- **Evacuation plan**: _Organization(s)_ spend resources to help people

# Why explore ?

---

Answer that kinds of questions

<br>

| What If ðŸ“¥ | How To ðŸ“¤ |
|:---|:---|
| An exit point is closed | Evacuate as soon as possible |
| Explosion of a factory in the Rouen industrial area | Evacuate the most non-autonomous people under resource constraints |

## ABM* exploration is expensive and time consuming !

**Let's do some maths :** 

For a simulation with 3 parameters with 10 values each 
10^3 = **1.000 simulations** * _repetitions_

<!-- COMOKIT -> 1000rep-->
<!--  With these 3 param -> 1 Billion simulations-->

---

## Objective : 
### Explore the entire parameter space with a minimal number of simulations

OpenMole provides functions to explore diversity in _input_ or _output_

# GAMA ![w:125](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/63448362) HPC

COMOKIT use-case

---

**Context**: OpenMole needs a specific virtualizator (_Singularity_) to run GAMA

**Problem**: That virtualizator is not install on the HPC

--

**Solution**: Use a custom setup to optimize parallelization run with GAMA's headless tools
